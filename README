Prototype is a SASS and Compass based starter theme built to leverage [Center](http://drupal.org/project/center). The goal of Prototype is to provide a good forking point for custom Drupal theme development by establishing a pattern of well organized SCSS components. Responsive web design is an important consideration for any starter Drupal theme, and Prototype aligns with this.

#### Requirements:
Prototype has dependencies. For Compass plugins, this means installing the appropriate gem and including them in your config.rb.
[Center](http://drupal.org/project/center)
[Compass](http://compass-style.org)
[Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/)vfor media queries.
[Zen Grids](http://breakpoint-sass.com/)- Prototype has very minimal layout classes, so this is easy to swap.
